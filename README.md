# :raised_hands: Ubuntu: Copy to Any Drive
Copy from Desktop or other any absolute path to any other drive in UBUNTU. 
:star: I programmed this script out of need. My motive was to copy anything directly from my Desktop to USB.

You just need to change "user" variable to your ubuntu "user" name.

```
// Change User
user=your current user's name
```

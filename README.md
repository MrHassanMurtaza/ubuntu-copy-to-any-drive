# :raised_hands: Ubuntu: Copy Folder to USB or Any Other Drive
Copy folders from Desktop or other any absolute path to any other drive in UBUNTU. 

I programmed this script out of need. My motive was to copy a folder with files directly from my Desktop to USB.

:star: You just need to change "user" variable to your ubuntu "user" name.

```
// Change User
user=your current user's name
```

Note: This works fine for just folders (directories). And, all the files in that directory will get copied.
